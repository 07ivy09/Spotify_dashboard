I built this dashboard to answer why certain tracks scale globally while others don’t, not just what the numbers show.

Instead of focusing only on totals, I structured the analysis around decision-driven questions:
🔍 Why do some tracks sustain high streams years after release?
🔍 Why does release timing matter more than artist popularity in some cases?
🔍 Why do specific audio features (energy, mode, danceability) appear repeatedly in top-performing tracks?
🔍 Why do listening patterns differ by day and month?

📊 What this dashboard enables decision-makers to do:
 ✔️ Identify long-term hit characteristics
 ✔️ Optimize release strategies using historical patterns
 ✔️ Understand listener behavior beyond surface-level metrics
 ✔️ Support data-driven A&R, marketing, and playlist decisions

🧠 Skills demonstrated:
 ✔ Business problem framing
 ✔ KPI design tied to decisions
 ✔ Analytical storytelling using Power BI
 ✔ Translating data into actionable insights
